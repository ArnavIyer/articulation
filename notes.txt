- randomly sampling num_points may not be as good as systematically sampling
  points for optimization on
- Using x,y,z representation of axis unit vector, but this optimization will
  fail if the norm of the vector becomes zero.
- Rodriguez rotation sometimes causes angles to be off by multiples of 180
